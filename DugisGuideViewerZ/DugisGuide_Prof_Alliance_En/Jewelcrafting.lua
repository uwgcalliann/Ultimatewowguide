N Please Read! |N|This guide assumes you are 90. However, you can still use this guide at lower levels, you'll just have to make sure you are high enough level to move on to the next step.|
N Note! |N|Jewelcrafting is a very diverse profession. The mats required to level this profession can sometimes be very expensive or hard to find, because of this creating a list of exact mats is very difficult, therefore the mats listed are for the basics of Jewelcrafting. Prospecting your own ore will yeild higher amount of needed mats.|
N Trainers |N|The trainers listed are the ones in Stormwind City. Obviously you can use others as you see fit.| |P|Jewelcrafting 2|
