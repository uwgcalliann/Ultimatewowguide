N Please Read! |N|This guide assumes you are at least level 83 and have learned the fishing skill. This is the huge fishing meta achievement guide which awards you the <Salty> title, plus The Limnologist and The Oceanographer achievements. There are several achievements required to do this, so this guide will try and go thru them step by step. This guide will also utilize other Daily guides as well. There is a lot of travel involved in this guide. But once you have fished all the available fish/items in a  zone, then you won't have to come back to that zone. Lets get started.|
N Fishing... |N|You can fish anywhere at any level. If you fish in high level areas at a low fishing level, you will just have a higher chance to catch "trash". Fishing in pools only will eliminate the "trash" catches. Tick this step.|
N Pools... |N|If you are having a hard time finding the pool you need to complete a step, fish the other pools in the area. The pools have a limited number available at any given time. Tick this step.| |AID|5478| |AC|30|
N Fish Don't Leave Footprints |N|After you reach lfishing level 100, watch for [Weather-Beaten Journal]. This is found in random trunks and crates fished from pools.| |AID|1516| |AC|12|
