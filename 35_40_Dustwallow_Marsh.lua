N Please Read!!! |QID|27254| |N|Go to Theramore and follow the bridge on the west side of there to (55.90, 49.50). At these coordinates, you will see an NPC named Zidormi. Speak to her and tell her you want to see Theramore before the fall. Easy as that, you travel back in time and now you are able to complete the required 60 quests so you can receive the Loremaster Kalimdor achievement and if like me, you have completed the Loremaster achievements in ALL OTHER ZONES, you receive your title and colors.
Then return to speak with Zidormi and ask her to return you to the present. Tick this step.|
